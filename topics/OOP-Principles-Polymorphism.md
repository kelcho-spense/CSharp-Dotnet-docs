# OOP Principles: Polymorphism

Polymorphism is one of the fundamental OOP concepts and is a term used to describe situations where something takes various roles or forms. In the programming world, these things can be operators or functions.

**Example1:**

Suppose you are in a classroom, then at that time, you will behave like a student. But when you are in the shopping mall, at that time you will behave like a customer. Again, when you are traveling on a bus, then you will behave like a passenger. And when you are at your home at that time, you will behave like a son or daughter. Here, you are one person but performing different behaviors. This is nothing but polymorphism. The behaviors change based on the place.

**Example2:**

A security guard in an organization behaves differently with different people entering the organization. The security behaves in a different way when the Boss comes and, in another way, when the employees come. And when the customers enter, the same security guard will respond differently. So here, the behavior of the security guard changes from person to person. It depends on the member who is entering the organization.

**Example3:**

Another good real-time example of polymorphism is water. We all know that water is a liquid at normal temperature, but it changes to a solid when it is frozen, and the same water changes to a gas when it is heated at its boiling point. This is also polymorphism

**Example4:**

One of the best real-time examples of polymorphism is Women in society. The same woman performs a different role in society. The woman can be the wife of someone, the mother of her child, can be doing a job in an organization, and many more at the same time. But the Woman is only one. So, the same woman performing different roles is nothing but performing polymorphism.

**The polymorphism can be implemented using the following three ways.**

* Method Overloading
* Operator Overloading
* Method Overriding
* Method Hiding
