# Introduction to C# Programming Language

## Why did C#.NET come to the market?

C#.NET Programming Language is mainly designed to overcome the disadvantages of C and C++ and to develop internet applications (web applications) by achieving platform independence.

## Why C# is so much popular nowadays?

C#.NET is so much popular nowadays because of the following reasons.

* C# is Simple and Familiar: C# is simple because C# simplifies the programmer’s job by avoiding certain features of C and C++. C# avoids explicit memory management. Memory management in C# is automatic. It is done by CLR.
* C# is Portable: Portability allows the programmer to write the same code for different machines (operating systems). C# provides portability in two ways

    - Source Code Portability
    - IL Code Portability (DLL and EXE)

* C# is Robust: Robust means Strong. C# is a strong type-checking language having strict type-checking during both compilation time and execution time which allows us to develop error-free applications and programs.
* C# is Multithreaded: A process is divided into several small parts known as threads or lightweight processes.
* C# is Dynamic: C# 4.0 introduced a new type called dynamic that avoids compile-time type checking. 
* C# is Compiled and Interpreted: We know a programming language is either compiled or interpreted. But C# combines both approaches. That’s why C# is called a two-stage system.
* C# is Object-Oriented: Except for the primitive data types, all elements in C# are objects.

## Types of Applications Developed using C#:

With the help of the C# programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust applications:

1. Window applications
2. Web applications
3. Distributed applications
4. Web service applications
5. Database applications
6. Mobile Applications, etc

## C# History

The history of the C# Programming Language is interesting to know. C# is pronounced as “C-Sharp”. 
It is an object-oriented programming language provided by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework, NET Core, or .NET. **Anders Hejlsberg** is known as the Founder of C# Programming Language.

C# (C# 1.0) was first introduced with .NET Framework 1.0 in the year 2002 and evolved much since then.
