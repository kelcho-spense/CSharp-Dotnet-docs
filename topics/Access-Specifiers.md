# Access Specifiers

Every keyword that we use such as private, public, protected, virtual, sealed, partial, abstract, static, base, etc. is called Modifiers. _Access Specifiers are special kinds of modifiers using which we can define the scope of a type and its members_.

So, in simple words, we can say that the Access Specifiers are used to define the **scope of the type** (**Class, Interface, Structs, Delegate, Enum, etc.**) as well as the **scope of their members (Variables, Properties, Constructors, and Methods**). Scope means accessibility or visibility that is who can access them and who cannot access them are defined by the Access Specifiers. See, I have a class with a set of members, who can consume these members, and who cannot consume these members are defined by the access specifiers.

C# supports **6 types of access specifiers**. They are as follows

**Private
Public
Protected
Internal
Protected Internal
Private Protected (C# Version 7.2 onwards)**
