## Why do we need Data Types in C#?

The Datatypes in C# are basically used to store the data temporarily in the computer through a program. In the real world, we have different types of data like integers, floating-point, characters, boolean, strings, etc. To store all these different kinds of data in a program to perform business-related operations, we need the data types.

## What is a Data Type in C#?

The Datatypes are something that gives information about

1. **Size** of the memory location.
2. The **Range of data** that can be stored inside that memory location
3. Possible **Legal Operations** that can be performed on that memory location.
4. What **Types of Results** come out from an expression when these types are used inside that expression?
The keyword which gives all the above information is called the data type in C#.
